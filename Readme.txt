The dataset contains 9-channel EEG signals from the occipital region of 24 subjects(6 females, 22 subjects aged 19-22 years, 2 subjects aged 54 and 46 respecitvely) under 5 stimulation paradigms with different stimulus sizes and arrangements, with a total of 120 MATLAB files. Stimuli were encoded using the joint frequency and phase modulation (JFPM) method. The stimulation frequencies ranged from 8 Hz to 13.5 Hz at intervals of 0.5 Hz. The stimulation phaes ranged from 0 Hz to 3.85pi at intervals of 0.35pi. 

The experiment required subjects to complete an offline prompted spelling task using a BCI speller. The experiment consisted of 5 paradigms of the task, each containing 8 blocks, and each block containing 12 trials corresponding to all 12 characters indicated in random order. The duration of each trail was 8 s, and the stimulation presentation process was divided into 3 steps: 
(1) Visual Cue: Before the arrival of the stimulation, a cue red dot was displayed on the screen for 2 s to assist with the cuing, which was used to prompt the user where to look when the next round of stimulation was displayed, corresponding to the red dot in the center of the stimulus;
(2) Stimulation Presentation: At the end of the cuing time, all stimuli started to flash for 4 s, and subjects were required to gaze at the stimulus corresponding to the cued red dot appeared in Visual Cue period at this time;
(3) Rest: after the stimulation presentation, there was a 2 s rest period, at which time the screen was grayed out and the countdown to the next stimulus was displayed in the upper right. 
After the 8 blocks of each paradigm, subjects were given 8 min to rest.

In this system, the device used for EEG signal acquisition was a NeuroHUB from Neuracle (Neuracle, Inc.), which acquired EEG signals at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. The placement of electrodes followed the extended 10-20 system. The nine electrodes in the occipital region selected for the experiments are Pz, PO5, Oz, O1, PO3, O2, PO4, POz and PO6 (ordered according to the number of the channels in the dataset). Besides, the electrodes were placed in the CPz and AFz positions as reference and ground. During the recording process, all the electrode resistance were kept below 10 kΩ. Stimulation events were generated by the stimulation program and were recorded on the event channel synchronized with the EEG data.

In the preparation stage before the experiment, the subjects were required to wash their scalp and wear a wet electrode EEG signal acquisition cap. The electrode channels were injected with conductive paste to acquire the EEG signals in a noninvasive manner. Then the principle of SSVEP, the style of the five stimulation paradigms used in the experiment were introduced, and the first block of Paradigm 1 was played to make the subjects understand the experiment. Subjects were also told to avoid blinking during the 5-second stimulation duration and not to think about other things as much as possible. The experimental environment was a dimly lit (light intensity of approximately 10 Lux), noiseless room. Subjects were required to sit comfortably in a chair at an eye distance of 60 cm from the screen in which the stimulation were presented.

Data epochs were extracted from the recorded continuous EEG signals based on the stimulation response from the event channel. For each trial, data for the stimulation presentation period of 4 s were extracted. In order to reduce the storage and computational cost, all epochs are downsampled to 250 Hz, while at the same time, a 50 Hz FIR notch filter is applied to remove the power line noise.

The dataset contains 120 MATLAB MAT files corresponding to the data under the 5-paradigm experiment for all 24 subjects (about 450 MB in total). The data were stored as double precision floating point values in MATLAB. The naming scheme is combined according to the subject index as well as the paradigm index, i.e., S1-1.mat, ..., S24-1.mat; S1-2.mat, ..., S24-2.mat; S1-3.mat, ..., S24-3.mat; S1-4. mat, ..., S24-4.mat; S1-5.mat, ..., S24-5.mat. Each file, when loaded, generates a 4-D matrix named "data" in the MATLAB workspace with dimensions [9, 1000, 12, 8]. The four dimensions respectively indicate "Electrode index", “Time points", "Target index", and "Block index". For the experiments under a single paradigm, the data matrix consists of 96 trials (12 targets × 8 blocks), and each trial consists of 9 channels of 4 s data length (4*250 = 1000 points).

The "Sub_info.txt" file gives information about all subjects. There are 4 parameters for each subject, including "Subject Index", "Gender", "Age" and "Group (with or without training)". Subjects were categorized into "experienced" group (2 subjects, S1-X-S2-X) and "naive" group (22 subjects, S3-X-S24-X) based on their experience in SSVEP-based brain-computer interface.
